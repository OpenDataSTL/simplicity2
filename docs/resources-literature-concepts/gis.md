# Client-Side GIS

This is a really cool project from the folks at MapBox. It lets you do spatial calculations/queries on the client or in node on GeoJSON through a nice API. It might be useful for occasions when we don’t want to hit the ArcGIS REST API… I’m thinking client side filtering, maybe… maybe not? Just wanted you to know it’s out there.
