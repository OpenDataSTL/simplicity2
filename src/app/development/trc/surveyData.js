I think people are confused and become distrustful when their comments are ruled out of order at the Technical Review Committee, or they're largely panned at the Planning and Zoning Committee. These technical issues are not everyday matters, and people being impacted by development not only are worried about what is coming, but confused by the information coming into them and the process.

There have been times the developer has given open houses or presentations, but those have generally gone over poorly as the developer isn't excited to be criticized all night, and the residents feel their points are not being received. While potentially much more costly in time, and maybe not efficiently so, I think it *could* be worthwhile for the City to have an open forum prior to the Technical Review Committee phase, hosted by the City, with a City official presiding, simply to listen.

This hypothetical official could issue a written response to be posted somewhere online that addresses the valid comments, much like comments submitted to the Federal Regulatory agencies. This forum could perhaps give residents an understanding of what comments are appropriate at Technical Review and P&Z, and why the City feels that certain issues are okay, or warrant further action (such as why there doesn't need to be further traffic mitigation, or why the development won't add more traffic, etc).

The development system is something of a shield for developers. The developers know that if their proposed projects meets the technical guidelines at the various stages, it cannot be derailed. This limits their need to reach out to the folks most affected by it. The City does not currently have a mechanism for teaching, creating understanding, or allowing people to lodge comments effectively. The only way a project can be stopped is through sheer political willpower. The ad nauseam repetition of this process leads to great distrust of the civic employees embedded in and in control of this system; ultimately hurting both developers and knowledgable city officials.

To use the timely example of Fuddruckers, I know many parents rushing to get to the grocery store before they pick up their child on the way home have great anxiety about the continued use of Chestnut St, which is already somewhat problematic, and non-representative of the ability of cars to move in other corridors. This proposed development brings them great concern about future planning, and I think they mainly want to have the opportunity, as people impacted by the development, to be heard. In turn, this could be a great opportunity for the City to explain why increased traffic won't be an issue, or to highlight solutions that have been identified, but are not forthcoming at the time of the review. This may go a long way in relieving some of the tensions in the development debates. ",,,,

Several recent meetings, including the most recent one about the Fuddruckers site and the hotel project on Woodfin St had NO CITY STAFF speaking or even in attendance. The City needs to lead and inform the conversations with the community, not be absent or late to the game. This is especially important as residents voice their issues at these meetings, and they aren't able to get information and data about what can/can't be done from a policy and regulation perspective about each project. The City should have a designated staff person to attend all of these meetings, armed with data, information and a willingness to listen objectively to residents.

The way our city gains more tax base, that can then support improvements to infrastructure, affordable housing programs, and other community amenities, is through new development. This development is especially financially remunerative to all residents when it occurs in the downtown area. Developers need a process that is transparent and reliable. Absent this, we as a community miss out on opportunities to create a more sustainable, long term tax base. This will require us to continue to take on debt, like the recent $74 million bond, to just keep up with maintenance of what we already own (roads/pipes/parks, etc). ",,,,

We have since stopped running the Air B&B due to our own personal travel.  It took a lengthy email back and forth with city representatives essentially proving that my tax dollars were being used to hire a 3rd party company to spy on my residence to ensure it indeed was being used as an Air B&B before initially sending me a zoning violation.  That doesn't seem very transparent and certainly not what I would want my tax dollars being spent on.  How about a sidewalk on West Chapel Rd and London Rd instead of nickel and diming a tax-paying citizen trying to make an extra buck for home improvements?!",,,,

I read about one development 30 units and only 25 parking spaces! Using City streets for parking is not good.  Living units need to provide parking for residents and a reasonable number of guests.
I do support public transit...encourage its use...but we still need to have parking for residents at their home.
In my own area, we in Hawthorne Villages and Mayfair Glen tried to stop part of the development on Dillingham...Crazy to put so many units there with several having short driveways that require owners to back out on to Dillingham.... dangerous to all who live there or drive by.    Our efforts did not result in any change.  I understand a traffic study was done...not enough traffic to require a change in design. If an owner has a party...folks will be parking all over Dillingham impeding traffic.   They are now putting in curbs and road...looks very narrow which will not be conducive to guest or vendor parking in that development. ",,,,

 3. we are a desirable place for developers - they should held to more than infrastructure to their project. There should be an additional levy to cover general city expenses for road repair/construction and other infrastructure issues. Keep raising the cost of doing business with the city until the sweet spot is achieved. Ease up on residential permits for owner occupied properties - they have become overbearing and people build without permits and city does not have the staff to enforce unless a complaint is filed by a neighbor.

It is important to consider who and what we are before approving more and more development, increasing stresses on infrastructure and neighborhood communities, especially the impact on the poor and underserved members of our community.  I am fairly new here, but in the last few years, I have seen a huge increase in large structures, multi-unit housing, corporate hotels, etc, but little increase in infrastructure to support the higher population. I've seen a shift in demographics that puts pressure on housing costs without an increase in economic opportunity or an influx of higher wage jobs to match the increases in housing costs; further exacerbating the income/expense discrepancy here.  I am concerned that Asheville is losing its soul, that which drew me to it in the first place. The gentrification is overshadowing the creative and joyful energy by putting so much pressure on people to manage that discrepancy, pushing out low-income members of our community in favor of attracting more wealthy people.
